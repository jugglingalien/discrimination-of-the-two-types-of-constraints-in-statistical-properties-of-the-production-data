	The initial step of this master thesis work was to quantify the characteristics of two hypothetical types of constraints in industrial production: technology-driven constraints and load-driven constraints. 
	
	I am planning to achieve this with an Operations Research Model consists of two steps. First, analyzing the statistical properties of association networks over Time in an extensive data set from steel manufacturing; second, developing an abstract theoretical framework to understand better the connection between each type of constraint and the statistical patterns created by them.
