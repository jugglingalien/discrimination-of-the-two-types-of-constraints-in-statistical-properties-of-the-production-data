	abstract = {Abstract Microbial metabolism provides at mechanism for the conversion of substrates into useful biochemicals. Utilization of microbes in industrial processes requires a modification of their natural metabolism in order to increase the efficiency of the desired conversion. Redirection of metabolic fluxes forms the 				basis of the newly defined field of metabolic engineering. In this study we use a flux balance based approach to study the biosynthesis of the 20 amino acids and 4 nucleotides as biochemical products. These amino acids and nucleotides are primary products of biosynthesis as well as important industrial products and 				precursors for the production of other biochemicals. The biosynthetic reactions of the bacterium Escherichia coli have been formulated into a metabolic network, and growth has been defined as a balanced drain on the metabolite pools corresponding to the cellular composition. Theoretical limits on the conversion of 				glucose, glycerol, and acetate substrates to biomass as well as the biochemical products have been computed. The substrate that results in the maximal carbon conversion to a particular product is identified. Criteria have been developed to identify metabolic constraints in the optimal solutions. The constraints of 					stoichiometry, energy, and redox have been determined in the conversions of glucose, glycerol, and acetate substrates into the biochemicals. Flux distributions corresponding to the maximal production of the biochemicals are presented. The goals of metabolic engineering are the optimal redirection of fluxes from 				generating biomass toward producing the desired biochemical. Optimal biomass generation is shown to decrease in a piecewise linear manner with increasing product formation. In some cases, synergy is observed between biochemical production and growth, leading to an increased overall carbon conversion. 					Balanced growth and product formation are important in a bioprocess, particularly for nonsecreted products. © 1993 John Wiley and Sons, Inc.},

These constraints have been classified as first, physico-chemical constraints; second, topobiological constraints; third, environmental constraints; and fourth, self-imposed regulatory constraints. These constraints can be represented mathematically, and a growing toolbox of computational analysis methods can be used to interrogate network properties.The most common set of computational tools uses linear programming to identify network states that are optimal relative to a defined objective. Flux balance analysis is an example. Optimal states have been successfully used for applications such as predicting the endpoint of adaptive evolutions of Escherichia coli.A more recently developed set of computational tools are used to quantify dependencies between fluxes in the network. For example, correlated reaction sets that form functional units, or unbiased modules, of a metabolic network can be determined.All allowable functional states of a biochemical network can be characterized in one of two ways: first, by enumerating network-based pathways that serve as a basis set from which all possible steady-state flux distributions can be generated or second, by using Monte-Carlo sampling of all possible functional states.The development of this field has matured to the point that phenotypes of altered strains can now be predicted. One such strategy, known as pOptKnock, uses gene deletions (or additions) to align the objective of an altered cell (optimal growth) with the necessary increase in the objective of the metabolic engineer (increased secretion of a particular compound). Adaptive evolution under selective pressure for growth rate is then used to select for strains that should produce the desired product at an increased rate.Future directions in this field include studying the achievable concentration states of biochemical networks, the range of in vivo kinetic constants consistent with high-throughput data and the incorporation of non-linear constraints.}

	ABSTRACT={The genome-scale cellular network has become a necessary tool in the systematic analysis of microbes. In a cell, there are several layers (i.e., types) of the molecular networks, for example, genome-scale metabolic network (GMN), transcriptional regulatory network (TRN), and signal transduction network (STN). It has been realized that the limitation and inaccuracy of the prediction exist just using only a single-layer network. Therefore, the integrated network constructed based on the networks of the three types attracts more interests. The function of a biological process in living cells is usually performed by the interaction of biological components. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate and analyze all the related components at the systems level for the comprehensively and correctly realizing the physiological function in living organisms. In this review, we discussed three representative genome-scale cellular networks: GMN, TRN, and STN, representing different levels (i.e., metabolism, gene regulation, and cellular signaling) of a cell’s activities. Furthermore, we discussed the integration of the networks of the three types. With more understanding on the complexity of microbial cells, the development of integrated network has become an inevitable trend in analyzing genome-scale cellular networks of microorganisms.}

GEM is built upon extensive experimental data and literature information on gene annotation and function, metabolites and enzymes so that it contains all known metabolic reactions within an organism. Constraint-based analysis of GEM enables the identification of phenotypic properties of an organism and hypothesis-driven engineering of cellular functions to achieve objectives. Along with the advances in omics, high-throughput technology and computational algorithms, the scope and applications of GEM have substantially expanded. In particular, various computational algorithms have been developed to predict beneficial gene deletion and amplification targets and used to guide the strain development process for the efficient production of industrially important chemicals. Furthermore, an Escherichia coli GEM was integrated with a pathway prediction algorithm and used to evaluate all possible routes for the production of a list of commodity chemicals in E. coli. Combined with the wealth of experimental data produced by high-throughput techniques, much effort has been exerted to add more biological contexts into GEM through the integration of omics data and regulatory network information for the mechanistic understanding and improved prediction capabilities. In this paper, we review the recent developments and applications of GEM focusing on the GEM-based computational algorithms available for microbial metabolic engineering.}",

	abstract = "Steel production scheduling is typically accomplished by human expert planners. Hence, instead of fully automated scheduling systems steel manufacturers prefer auxiliary recommendation algorithms. Through the suggestion of suitable orders, these algorithms assist human expert planners who are tasked with the selection and scheduling of orders for immediate production. However, given the lack of rule-based procedures, as well as the anecdotal evidence about the required domain knowledge and intuition acquired by years of experience, it is hard to guess, what complexity is required by algorithms serving as decision support tools in the context of steel production campaign planning. Here, we introduce a novel network-based method for assessing the complexity of the selection patterns created by a human expert. This method allows formalizing and representing the tacit knowledge that enters the campaign planning. We are convinced that our approach can be employed in a range of other application domains, where a human expert creates groups of orders ('campaigns') fulfilling certain implicit criteria. As a result of the network analysis, we have discovered that the choice of orders for a given production campaign is primarily determined by the steel’s carbon content. Surprisingly, secondary elements like manganese, silicon, and titanium have a lesser impact on the planning decision than assumed by the pertinent literature."

This task is posed mathematically as a generalized network optimization problem. The minimal reaction sets capable of supporting specified growth rates are determined for two different uptake conditions: (i) limiting the uptake of organic material to a single organic component (e.g., glucose or acetate) and (ii) allowing the importation of any metabolite with available cellular transport reactions. We find that minimal reaction network sets are highly dependent on the uptake environment and the growth requirements imposed on the network. Specifically, we predict that the E. coli network, as described by the flux balance model, requires 224 metabolic reactions to support growth on a glucose-only medium and 229 for an acetate-only medium, while only 122 reactions enable growth on a specially engineered growth medium.},

A key issue that may arise in the use of such models is the existence of alternate optimal solutions wherein the same maximal objective (e.g., growth rate) can be achieved through different flux distributions. Herein, we investigate the effects that alternate optimal solutions may have on the predicted range of flux values calculated using currently practiced linear (LP) and quadratic programming (QP) methods. An efficient LP-based strategy is described to calculate the range of flux variability that can be present in order to achieve optimal as well as suboptimal objective states. Sample results are provided for growth predictions of E. coli using glucose, acetate, and lactate as carbon substrates. These results demonstrate the extent of flux variability to be highly dependent on environmental conditions and network composition. In addition we examined the impact of alternate optima for growth under gene knockout conditions as calculated using QP-based methods. It was observed that calculations using QP-based methods can show significant variation in growth rate if the flux variability among alternate optima is high. The underlying biological significance and general source of such flux variability is further investigated through the identification of redundancies in the network (equivalent reaction sets) that lead to alternate solutions. Collectively, these results illustrate the variability inherent in metabolic flux distributions and the possible implications of this heterogeneity for constraint-based modeling approaches. These methods also provide an efficient and robust method to calculate the range of flux distributions that can be derived from quantitative fermentation data.}

Here mixed-integer linear programming was used to calculate and study a subset of the alternate optimal solutions for a genome-scale metabolic model of Escherichia coli (iJR904) under a wide variety of environmental conditions. Analysis of the calculated sets of optimal solutions found that: (1) only a small subset of reactions in the network have variable fluxes across optima; (2) sets of reactions that are always used together in optimal solutions, correlated reaction sets, showed moderate agreement with the currently known transcriptional regulatory structure in E. coli and available expression data, and (3) reactions that are used under certain environmental conditions can provide clues about network regulatory needs. In addition, calculation of suboptimal flux distributions, using flux variability analysis, identified reactions which are used under significantly more environmental conditions suboptimally than optimally. Together these results demonstrate the utilization of reactions in genome-scale models under a variety of different growth conditions.},

Working from the annotated genome sequence, as well as biochemical and physiological information, it is possible to reconstruct complete metabolic networks. Furthermore, computational methods have been developed to interpret and predict the optimal performance of a metabolic network under a range of growth conditions. We have tested the hypothesis that Escherichia coli uses its metabolism to grow at a maximal rate using the E. coli MG1655 metabolic reconstruction. Based on this hypothesis, we formulated experiments that describe the quantitative relationship between a primary carbon source (acetate or succinate) uptake rate, oxygen uptake rate, and maximal cellular growth rate. We found that the experimental data were consistent with the stated hypothesis, namely that the E. coli metabolic network is optimized to maximize growth under the experimental conditions considered. This study thus demonstrates how the combination of in silico and experimental biology can be used to obtain a quantitative genotype–phenotype relationship for metabolism in bacterial cells.},

It is not clear whether in such a situation a plausible global relational structure—or map—of these hypotheses emerges in the minds of the involved researchers and, if so, how this map can be reliably reconstructed from the expertise of individuals. Here, we report results of an online survey with 357 experts on invasion biology and several reconstructions of such a map. Using the distance information between hypotheses provided in the survey, the resulting network is essentially random. This finding implies that invasion biologists currently do not have a joint vision how invasion hypotheses are related to each other. However, the pattern of pairwise familiarities between the hypotheses in the survey yields joint-mentions networks with highly non-random features. These networks allow us to assign conceptual roles to many of the hypotheses in the field on purely topological grounds. Such hypothesis networks can help everyone interested in research fields to understand their conceptual structure. They can serve as maps of research fields.},
