\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

% This page is optional. You may acknowledge whom you will --- your advisor, colleagues, family members. Please keep acknowledgments in good taste. I would like to acknowledge Dr. Kristine Hansen, Associate Dean of General Education for Composition, and Dr. Elizabeth Hedengren, Writing-Across-Curriculum Consultant, for providing motivation to this project and also for valuable information presented in their Advanced Writing Seminar. Many of the ideas presented herein were taken from the seminar with no attempt being made to reference original sources. I also wish to thank Jean-Francois Van Huele, Steven Turley, and Ross Spencer for reviewing this document and for ripping it to shreds as every good advisor should do to a thesis draft.
