\section{Research Objective}

{\color{red} 
	
	A valid theoretical framework for discrimination of the two types of constraints in statistical properties of the production data
	
	First, formulate the binning methods here because this will describe the hypothesis underlining my thesis.
	
	Explanation of my hypothesis is a theoretical/conceptual framework as a starting point for the investigation. It is a well-defined object and based on facts.

\section{Research Plan and Thesis Organization}

{\color{red} 
	
	Methods are introduced here as indicative of two fundamentally different constraints acting on the manufacturing process: technological constraints on the one hand and constraints related to material flow and production capacity on the other.
