\chapter{Methods}
This chapter introduces the proposed concepts used in our \acs{or} model as association networks, binning methods, network metrics analysis, and an optimisation scheme, \acf{fba} for the simulation framework.

In the coming section, we introduce the integrated techniques to create non-random topological features in the production data association networks that come from different types of constraints. 

Afterwards, we introduce the Flux Balance Analysis, which consists of a linear set of fluxes of material flows. The goal is to find the pattern of material flow that maximises the output. The advantage of this approach: the notion of constraints is already present in that framework.
