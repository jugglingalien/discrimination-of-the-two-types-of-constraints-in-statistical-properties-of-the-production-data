\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

I would like to acknowledge Professor Dr Marc-Thorsten Hütt, principal investigator in the SMS group project, for motivating this project and the valuable information presented in our meetings. Many of the ideas presented herein were taken from those meeting conversations. I also wish to thank Daniel Christopher Merten for reviewing the thesis draft and ripping it to shreds, as every good advisor would do. Lastly, I want to thank Dr Atilla Özgür for providing me access to the data source that the complete thesis work is established.
