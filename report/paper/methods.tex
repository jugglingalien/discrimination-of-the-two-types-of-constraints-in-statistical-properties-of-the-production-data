\chapter{Methods}
This chapter introduces the proposed concepts used in our \acs{or} model as association networks, binning methods, network metrics analysis, and an optimisation scheme, \acf{fba} for the simulation framework.

Different types of constraints create non-random topological features in the production data association networks for alternative binning schemes. In FBA, we consider a model consists of a linear set of fluxes of material flows. The goal is to find the pattern of material flow that maximises the output. The advantage of this approach: the notion of constraints is already present in that framework. Creating sets of experimental data from the simulation allows comparing the statistical characteristics of their association network with those formed from the production data set from steel manufacturing.
