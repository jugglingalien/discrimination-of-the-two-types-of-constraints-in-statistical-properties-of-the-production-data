\chapter{Methodology}
{\color{red} 
	Introduce proposed concepts in the OR model.
	
	Here is a brief introduction to Association Networks, Modularity as a Complex Networks metric, Randomization with Null Models and Flux Balance Analysis (FBA).
	
	Introducing the analysis of the real-life events with the related concepts and explain the relation of the thesis hypothesis with this analysis pipeline.
	
	Here is an explanation for generating a data structure with OR-modeling in the combination of those. Usage of linear programming and creating sets of synthetic data allow comparing the statistical characteristics of their association network with those formed from the real-world data set from steel manufacturing.
	
	Mention that more detailed information will be given in the following sections, guide the readers who know Association Network and FBA concepts to the Applications and Results Chapter.
