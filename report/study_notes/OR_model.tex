why am I implementing FBA analysis model into my dataset?
Because I need to have a better theoretical understanding.

Balances (conserved quantities) -> energy, mass, momentum, osmotic pressure, solvent capacity, electro-neutrality

Bounds (limit numerical ranges of variables) -> concentrations, fluxes, kinetic constants

constraints on the level of - diversity on production plans
							- resources
							intrinsic capabilities (how many links do we have in the network? Non-zero elements do we have in stochiometric matrix?)
