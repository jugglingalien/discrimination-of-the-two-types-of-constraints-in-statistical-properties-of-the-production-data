Constraints lead to statistical patterns in data. The initial step of this master thesis work is to quantify the characteristics of two hypothetical types of constraints in industrial production: technology-driven constraints and load-driven constraints. This will be achieved by analyzing the statistical properties of association networks over time in a large data set from steel manufacturing. Based on these results, an abstract theoretical framework will be developed to better understand the connection between each type of constraint and the statistical patterns created by it.
