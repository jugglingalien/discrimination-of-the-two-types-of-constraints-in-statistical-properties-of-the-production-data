\section{Applications and Results of the Developed Framework}
\subsection{Real-life Events Analysis Results}
Results are not stable which is a bit expected with these complicated data structures. This is why we do the sensitivity analysis on top of that: varying the resolution, doing things with slightly different methods (different null models) over and over again. In some sense, we try to do the data as simpler as they are, by trying to pretend that they are more homogeneous than they are. We pretend that the data is statistically reliable and not distorted and most of all that this temple of the modular network really fits. All of these assumptions are slightly wrong, what we see here is the consequence of that. We need to try to make the statistical assumptions about the data that are not necessarily fulfilled and these assumptions can lead to things sometimes looking statistically significant even though they are not. And those statistical assumptions are most of the time that the data are not very distorted but somehow reliably distributed. And top of that, modularity as a fairly simple concept of characterizing networks, is a meaningful concept here. We should say that these are all assumptions.
\subsection{Integration of Concepts}
