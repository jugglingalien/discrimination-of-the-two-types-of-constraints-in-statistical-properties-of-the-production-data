{\color{red}

Investigation of constraints impact in time windows was performed by analyze in two different type of association networks; the networks with fixed step size nodes and the networks with fixed bucket size nodes.

those two different type of networks were applied in all 10 time windows and some relevant network metric plots were generated. 
Average degree vs time windows
Average betweenness centrality vs time windows
Average modularity vs time windows
