	abstract = {Abstract Microbial metabolism provides at mechanism for the conversion of substrates into useful biochemicals. Utilization of microbes in industrial processes requires a modification of their natural metabolism in order to increase the efficiency of the desired conversion. Redirection of metabolic fluxes forms the 				basis of the newly defined field of metabolic engineering. In this study we use a flux balance based approach to study the biosynthesis of the 20 amino acids and 4 nucleotides as biochemical products. These amino acids and nucleotides are primary products of biosynthesis as well as important industrial products and 				precursors for the production of other biochemicals. The biosynthetic reactions of the bacterium Escherichia coli have been formulated into a metabolic network, and growth has been defined as a balanced drain on the metabolite pools corresponding to the cellular composition. Theoretical limits on the conversion of 				glucose, glycerol, and acetate substrates to biomass as well as the biochemical products have been computed. The substrate that results in the maximal carbon conversion to a particular product is identified. Criteria have been developed to identify metabolic constraints in the optimal solutions. The constraints of 					stoichiometry, energy, and redox have been determined in the conversions of glucose, glycerol, and acetate substrates into the biochemicals. Flux distributions corresponding to the maximal production of the biochemicals are presented. The goals of metabolic engineering are the optimal redirection of fluxes from 				generating biomass toward producing the desired biochemical. Optimal biomass generation is shown to decrease in a piecewise linear manner with increasing product formation. In some cases, synergy is observed between biochemical production and growth, leading to an increased overall carbon conversion. 					Balanced growth and product formation are important in a bioprocess, particularly for nonsecreted products. © 1993 John Wiley and Sons, Inc.},

The complete genome sequence for a number of organisms is available and the analysis of genome sequence data is proving very useful. Thus, genome sequencing projects and bioinformatic analyses are leading to a complete ‘parts catalog’ of the molecular components in many organisms. The next challenge will be to reconstruct and simulate overall cellular functions based on the extensive reductionist information. Recent advances have been made in the area of flux balance analysis, a mathematical modeling approach often utilized by metabolic engineers to quantitatively simulate microbial metabolism.}}

	abstract = {The range of allowable biochemical network functions is constrained by natural law. These constraints have been classified as first, physico-chemical constraints; second, topobiological constraints; third, environmental constraints; and fourth, self-imposed regulatory constraints. These constraints can be represented mathematically, and a growing toolbox of computational analysis methods can be used to interrogate network properties.The most common set of computational tools uses linear programming to identify network states that are optimal relative to a defined objective. Flux balance analysis is an example. Optimal states have been successfully used for applications such as predicting the endpoint of adaptive evolutions of Escherichia coli.A more recently developed set of computational tools are used to quantify dependencies between fluxes in the network. For example, correlated reaction sets that form functional units, or unbiased modules, of a metabolic network can be determined.All allowable functional states of a biochemical network can be characterized in one of two ways: first, by enumerating network-based pathways that serve as a basis set from which all possible steady-state flux distributions can be generated or second, by using Monte-Carlo sampling of all possible functional states.The development of this field has matured to the point that phenotypes of altered strains can now be predicted. One such strategy, known as pOptKnock, uses gene deletions (or additions) to align the objective of an altered cell (optimal growth) with the necessary increase in the objective of the metabolic engineer (increased secretion of a particular compound). Adaptive evolution under selective pressure for growth rate is then used to select for strains that should produce the desired product at an increased rate.Future directions in this field include studying the achievable concentration states of biochemical networks, the range of in vivo kinetic constants consistent with high-throughput data and the incorporation of non-linear constraints.}

	ABSTRACT={The genome-scale cellular network has become a necessary tool in the systematic analysis of microbes. In a cell, there are several layers (i.e., types) of the molecular networks, for example, genome-scale metabolic network (GMN), transcriptional regulatory network (TRN), and signal transduction network (STN). It has been realized that the limitation and inaccuracy of the prediction exist just using only a single-layer network. Therefore, the integrated network constructed based on the networks of the three types attracts more interests. The function of a biological process in living cells is usually performed by the interaction of biological components. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate and analyze all the related components at the systems level for the comprehensively and correctly realizing the physiological function in living organisms. In this review, we discussed three representative genome-scale cellular networks: GMN, TRN, and STN, representing different levels (i.e., metabolism, gene regulation, and cellular signaling) of a cell’s activities. Furthermore, we discussed the integration of the networks of the three types. With more understanding on the complexity of microbial cells, the development of integrated network has become an inevitable trend in analyzing genome-scale cellular networks of microorganisms.}

	abstract = "{Genome-scale metabolic network model (GEM) is a fundamental framework in systems metabolic engineering. GEM is built upon extensive experimental data and literature information on gene annotation and function, metabolites and enzymes so that it contains all known metabolic reactions within an organism. Constraint-based analysis of GEM enables the identification of phenotypic properties of an organism and hypothesis-driven engineering of cellular functions to achieve objectives. Along with the advances in omics, high-throughput technology and computational algorithms, the scope and applications of GEM have substantially expanded. In particular, various computational algorithms have been developed to predict beneficial gene deletion and amplification targets and used to guide the strain development process for the efficient production of industrially important chemicals. Furthermore, an Escherichia coli GEM was integrated with a pathway prediction algorithm and used to evaluate all possible routes for the production of a list of commodity chemicals in E. coli. Combined with the wealth of experimental data produced by high-throughput techniques, much effort has been exerted to add more biological contexts into GEM through the integration of omics data and regulatory network information for the mechanistic understanding and improved prediction capabilities. In this paper, we review the recent developments and applications of GEM focusing on the GEM-based computational algorithms available for microbial metabolic engineering.}",
