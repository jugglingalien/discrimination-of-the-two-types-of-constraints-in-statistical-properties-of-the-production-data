		\begin{itemize}
			\item We linked these two data processing schemes: Fixed Step Sized binning and	Fixed Bucket Sized binning, to different constraint categories and obtained different results in the steel production events analysis.
			\item With Flux Balance Analysis, we constrained the system	at different levels and allowed for fluctuations in the input and controlled the products via objective functions.
			\item Further perturbation experiments can be performed with a randomly structured graph (set of production rules) instead of a ready model (as we used the homo sapiens metabolic model).
			\item The main challenge would be to construct arbitrary networks within the Operations Research framework. Therefore, different categories of constraints such as technical constraints, logistic constraints, physical and chemical constraints, economical constraints, and performance-indicator based constraints need to be quantified carefully in this framework.
