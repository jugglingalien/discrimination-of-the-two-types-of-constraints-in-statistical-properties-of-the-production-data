FBA is a good control model and can be used with a random graph considering some additional consistency constraints. Need to make sure that the cycles in the graph are suitable to create stuff out of nothing. There are some mass balance constraints that need to be incorporated.

Network perturbation might be another further study subject by upgrading the OR-model with advance tools.
