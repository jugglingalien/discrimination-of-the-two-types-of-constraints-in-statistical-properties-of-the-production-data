Quantifying the characteristics of a distinction between two hypothetical concept: Technology-Driven Production Type and Load Driven Production Type by analyzing production data among time windows is the initial step of this master thesis work. Based on the gained data behavior, a valid theoretical framework sensitive to statistical properties not limited to a singular production data is aimed to be modeled as having a more general functionality.
