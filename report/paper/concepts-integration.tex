\section{Integration of Concepts}
\textcolor{red}{What happens here is to bring the simulated data into a format that is compatible with my analysis of the real-life events data.}

{\color{red} 
	An event is a single run of my optimization algorithm.
	
	
	
	In an ideal scenario, we would find that association networks derived from the generated data, in the one case; produce high modularity for FBS and in the other case produce high modularity for FSS. Because then we have linked these two data processing schemes to different forms/to different categories of constraints.
